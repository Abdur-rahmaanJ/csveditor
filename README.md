# csveditor
A lightweight GUI csv editor.

### I plan to make this: 
* open & save csv files, 
* scale for larger files
* let you edit the files, and save the changes
* be easy to use
* color/font settings file?
* bold headers

I wanted to make this because I found I was making tables in Excel often, and needed something more lightweight.

Copy/Pasting to/from Excel is horrible, so I plan to create something that will solve my problem.
