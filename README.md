# csveditor
A lightweight GUI csv editor.

### This Will: 
* open & save csv files, 
* let you view and edit csv files
* have bold headers

### I plan on adding:
* color/font settings file?
* better keyboard support (arrow keys, enter to go down a line)

I wanted to make this because I found I was making tables in Excel often, and needed something more lightweight.

Copy/Pasting to/from Excel is horrible, so I plan to create something that will solve my problem.
